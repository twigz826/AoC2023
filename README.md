## Advent Of Code 2023

### Overview
I will be doing the Advent of Code 2023 challenge in C#, as it's something I have always wanted to do but never quite found the time or made it a priority.

### Day 1

Find the calibration value by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
